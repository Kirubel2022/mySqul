The first question asks to select and display the whole information from the users 
and progress table. 
What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)?
How many .edu learners are located in New York?
The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. 
How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?

my Answer for these question is 

SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM progress;

SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE email_domain LIKE '%.edu'
 LIMIT 25; 

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users 
WHERE city = 'New York' AND email_domain LIKE '%.edu';

SELECT mobile_app FROM users WHERE mobile_app = 'mobile-user' OR mobile_app = IS NULL;

SELECT count(mobile_app) FROM users WHERE mobile-user=' Codecademy learners';

The second question asks the data type of the DATETIME found in sign_up column.

  SELECT sign_up_at, strftime('%H', sign_up_at) FROM users GROUP BY 1 LIMIT 20;

  the last question asks us to join the two tables using JOIN tables using schools and courses data. 

Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
What courses are the New Yorkers students taking?
What courses are the Chicago students taking?

SELECT * FROM users AS U LEFT JOIN progress AS P ON U.user_id = p.user_id;

SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_cpp FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'New York' AND learn_cpp = 'started';

SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_javascript FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'New York' AND learn_javascript = 'started';


SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_sql FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'New York' AND learn_sql = 'started';


SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_html FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'New York' AND learn_html = 'started';


SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_html FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'Chicago' AND learn_html = 'started';
SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_javascript FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'Chicago' AND learn_javascript = 'started';

 SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_sql FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'Chicago' AND learn_sql = 'started';


SELECT users.user_id,progress.user_id, users.city, progress.learn_java FROM users JOIN progress ON users.user_id = progress.user_id WHERE city = 'Chicago' AND learn_java = 'started';
